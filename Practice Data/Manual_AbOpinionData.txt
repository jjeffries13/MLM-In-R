The data come from British Social Attitudes(BSA) Survey started in 1983. The eligible persons were all adults aged 18 or over living in private households in Britain. The sampling was multi-stage. At the first stage, parliamentary constituencies were sampled with probability proportionate to electorate size (PPES). At the second stage, districts were sampled out of the selected constituencies with PPES again. Thirdly, addresses from each of the selected districts were sampled. At the fourth stage an individual was randomly selected at each address. The data refer to surveys carried out in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. There were seven dichotomous items asking whether the respondent supported or opposed a woman's right to have an abortion under different circumstances each year. Finally, there were 410 respondents who responded to all four years' interviews. The data consist of completed results of 264 respondents out of 410 with 9 variables for each record. There are 1056 records from the joining of four years' data.  The format is as follows:
